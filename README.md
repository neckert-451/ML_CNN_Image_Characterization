Repository for all the files and code related to the NERS/MSE machine learning research project (Fall 2019)

This research effort was a project designed to create an image recognition machine learning algorithm to identify cracks and inclusions in irradiated samples of 316 stainless steel. The images were collected and supplied by the Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Sciences (NERS) department and the image processing, data scrubbing, and AI algorithm was done by an undergraduate student in the Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) department. All work was performed at the University of Michigan.
